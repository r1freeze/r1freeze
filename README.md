- 👋 Hi, I’m @r1freeze
- 👀 I’m interested in FPGA region, familiar with verilog/system verilog, modelsim, ...etc.  
     Especially interested in anything that can improve the FPGA engineering development experiment,  
     including those can help to build friendly envirement, like powershell, vscode, ...etc.  
     
- 🌱 I’m currently learning TCL (under Vivado console).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on 
     "FINDING AN EASY WAY to developed better custom enviroment under Vivado GUI"  
     (This is not about how to use the constrains/ working flow,  
      But more about the file/project control itself, like version control, usful costum command/library developement & easy install/uninstalling, etc.)  
- 📫 How to reach me ...
     Please feel free to send me an email if you have any cool ideas about this kind of "TOOL's development" :)
